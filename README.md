### Branch Hierarchy <br/>

**Master**

-   Master contains everything approved for 'deployment'
    -   For development needs, see **_dev_**
-   This branch is highly protected and should be infrequently updated
-   Approval for deployment requires an ok by at least 4/6 engineers on the team
    -   **The Project Manager, Technical Manager,** and at least **2 other engineers**

**Dev**

-   Our primary/default branch is **_dev_**
    -   All part / feature branches are based on **_dev_** -- the development branch
-   The **_dev_** branch will largely take on the role that _master_ traditionally does,
    while the real master largely lies untouched
-   Updates to **_dev_** should be handled with care.
    -   **The technical manager should review all PRs directed into this branch**

    annotate all functions, classes, interfaces, etc. within .ts files.
-   Outside of .ts files, documentation consists of README files in applicable subdirectories.
