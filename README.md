### About Branches  <br/>
- Our default branch is ***master***
      - Master contains everything approved for 'deployment'
      - Approval for deployment requires an ok by at least 4/6 engineers on the team
- All name branches are based on ***dev*** -- the development branch
  - ***Dev*** will serve as a pseudo-master, while the real master branch will be highly protected
  - Updates to ***dev*** should be handled with care. But they will not be blocked unless code <br/>
          belonging to someone else is directly impacted by the proposed changes.
  
          In this event, the change will be blocked from updating the development branch until the  
          appropriate code owners have reviewed the proposed changes.
- Parts and features will be developed on individual engineer branches in whatever way suits the engineer
  - The whole point is for everyone to have *their own space* to do their work within the team! ðŸ˜„
- Although suggested by GitHub when PRs complete, the deletion of any major branch is blocked by its ruleset.
